## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on the automatic classification of dysarthria severity levels from speech recordings. Dysarthria, a motor speech disorder, can significantly affect speech clarity, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention.

The proposed approach introduces **in-domain data augmentation** to enhance the generalization capability of machine learning models. Specifically, the method leverages acoustic variability within the dataset to improve classification performance across severity levels.

## 🏆 Achievement

This work was **accepted and published at SPCOM 2024**, one of India's premier conferences on signal processing and communications. The proposed model demonstrated a **42.86% improvement in classification accuracy** over the baseline using domain-specific augmentation strategies.
