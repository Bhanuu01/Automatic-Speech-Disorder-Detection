# Speech Disorder Detection using Advanced Speech Processing and Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging advanced speech processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to develop a model capable of accurately detecting speech disorders, specifically Dysarthria, in audio files. Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that affects the physical production of speech sounds, and its severity can vary.

The primary goals of the project are:

1. **Accurate Detection:** Develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying the presence of Dysarthria in audio recordings.

2. **Severity Assessment:** Implement a severity assessment mechanism to gauge the extent of Dysarthria in detected cases.
